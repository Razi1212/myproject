              I'm passionate about designing and developing seamless, responsive
              UI/UX experiences and building scalable, efficient web
              applications. I'm seeking challenging opportunities that allow me
              to grow alongside the organization's growth. As an experienced ECE
              graduate, I'm highly enthusiastic about full-stack development,
              with a special focus on front-end. Outside of coding, I'm a boxing
              enthusiast and an avid gardener.

              Worked at CentraHub for ValueGold and Finance House, where I
              designed and implemented workflows to import and process Excel
              data â€” extracting gold purity values and mapping them into modules
              using JavaScript. Developed parameter-driven SQL query reports for
              customized, high-performance reporting. Implemented dynamic
              JavaScript logic to fetch and handle data across multiple modules,
              and enhanced UI responsiveness by enabling real-time grid
              population on user actions.

              Built a dynamic job portal for Al-Sayed Staffing, allowing users
              to browse available jobs, perform real-time searches with
              debounced input for performance, and submit applications with
              resume uploads and personal details. Developed an admin panel with
              secure session-based authentication so authorized admins can
              create and manage job listings, view detailed candidate
              applications, preview resumes, and securely download or delete
              them. Added efficient pagination for smooth navigation of large
              job listings.
